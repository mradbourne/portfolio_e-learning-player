        <p>
          <span data-begin="0" data-end="18">In the previous section we explored some of the goals for a sustainable built environment. In order to achieve these goals such as zero carbon, preservation of natural habitats and healthy societies, we firstly have to identify why we are living in an unsustainable way.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="18" data-end="39">The key overarching driver for a sustainable built environment is our behaviour. This is true for our interaction both with the environment and within our own communities and societies. If the way we behave is unsustainable, by extension changing behavious is the primary barrier to sustainability.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="39" data-end="58">The built environment is a key battleground for this behaviour change. More than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population now lives in urban areas and this percentage is set to rise. Given this pressure, traditional methods of developing and using the built environment will become increasingly ineffective.</span>

        <h4>Transcript</h4>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="0" data-end="14">Ecosystems supply goods such as food and provide services such as waste assimilation for us to use. These services are free of charge but they have a critical value that we have taken for granted. Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="14" data-end="29">A cloud masses, the sky darkens, leaves twist upwards and we know that it will rain. We also know that the storm run-off will feed into groundwater miles away and that the sky will clear by tomorrow.</span>
          <span data-begin="29" data-end="46">All these events are distant in time and space but are connected with the same pattern. Each pattern has an influence on the rest, often hidden from view. We can only understand the system of a rainstorm by contemplating the whole over a long period of time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="46" data-end="64">Most natural ecosystems are closed loops, meaning they produce no waste. Everything is broken down and used within the system, the climate being a good example of this. A successful ecosystem goes on and on, balancing itself as it goes.</span>
          <span data-begin="64" data-end="76">Most of the environmental problems we have created stem from the fact that we pollute these closed loop ecosystems or remove key materials and resources, creating imbalances and waste.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span data-begin="76" data-end="90">We are very much a part of these ecosystems; we have to interact with them in order to live, but in doing so we have upset their delicate balance. This has caused ecosystems to become stressed.</span>
          <span data-begin="90" data-end="103">Many are now breaking down, which reduces their ability to provide us with the goods and services we take for granted. Thinking about the interactions in this way is called &lsquo;systems thinking&rsquo;.</span>
         </p>
         <p>
          <span data-begin="103" data-end="118">To investigate how we and our built environment interact with ecosystems we have identified six areas: climate change, transport, resources, waste, water, and community.</span>
          <span data-begin="118" data-end="128">As we look at each of these areas we will give some indication, through the built environment life cycle, of the impact that working towards sustainability may have on them.</span>

                <div class="definition">Allosaurus is one of the best known carnosaurs. Sixty individuals, from juveniles to adults, were found at one site in Utah. It is likely that Allosaurus may have been the most common carnosaur of the Late Jurassic. Despite its size, Allosaurus is thought to have been a speedy hunter, running with a 3.7-meter-long stride at up to 20 mph. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the presence of two short horns, above and in front of each eye.</div>

                <div class="definition">A medium-sized member of the prosauropod family, this primitive plant-eater was characterized by a small head, long neck and large body. Discovered in a quarry in Connecticut in the late 1800s, only the back half of the specimen was rescued by Othniel Charles Marsh; the front half having already been sawed into blocks to build a bridge near South Manchester. In 1969, more parts of the Ammosaurus were discovered when a nearby sandstone bridge was demolished.</div>

                <div class="definition">Discovered in the Gobi desert of Mongolia, Bagaceratops was a small, primitive ceratopsian. It had a very small horn on its nose and its neck was protected by a very short frill. Glossary In Asia, the protoceratopsians were prevalent during the Late Cretaceous, while no certain neoceratopsians are known, whereas at the same time in North America, the neoceratopsians were more prevalent and only a few protoceratopsians have been discovered.</div>

                <div class="definition">Brachiosaurus is one of the largest known land animals, based on a complete skeleton found in Tanzania. Each neck vertebra was more than 3 feet (1 meter) long. Its large nostrils were located on top of its head, which caused speculation that Brachiosaurus might have spent time submerged in water. However, recent studies have shown that a creature as large as Brachiosaurus could not have inhaled and inflated its lungs against the water pressure at depths of total submergence. Its front legs were longer than its rear legs and it stood 24 feet (7.3 meters) at the shoulder. It had small narrow feet for its size and the first digit of the front foot had a claw as did the first three digits of the hind foot. The function of the claws is unknown though they may have been used for raking plants or in self defense.</div>

                <div class="definition">Ceratosaurus was found in western North America. It has horns above and forward of its eyes, resembling those of Allosaurus, but it Ceratosaurus derives its name from its extremely unusual, rather large nose horn. Because Ceratosaurus was a very large predator, it is not likely that the horn was a weapon. Possibly it was a secondary sex characteristic, identifying males or females; perhaps it was used in ritual mating battles between males. It has also been suggested that the horn was used by hatchlings to break out of their eggs.</div>

Joseph Leidy, an anatomist from Philadelphia, named the first American dinosaurs in 1856 based on fossils brought back from Montana by Ferdinand Hayden. Leidy identified a jaw and 12 enormous teeth as belonging to a ferocious megalosaurid he christened Deinodon horridus. Upon further analysis of the remains since Deinodons discovery, the dinosaur was determined to actually be Tyrannosaurus, making Deinodon an invalid dinosaur.</div>

                <div class="definition">Discovered in England and described by Sir Richard Owen in 1861, Echinodon was once considered to be a fabrosaurid, a family name that has now been abandoned. It may have been related to Scutellosaurus, a plant-eater with small bony armor plates on its back. Evidence suggests that armor found in England in 1879 and thought to belong to a lizard, may belong to Echinodon, thus moving it into the mostly quadrupedal Thyreophora suborder of ornithischians.</div>
